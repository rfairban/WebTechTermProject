Term Project: Dungeons and Dragons Character Creator

Purpose:

The purpose of the website is to allow users to create and save their character specifications for the game Dungeons and Dragons. Features instructions to guide the user in this process.

User's Guide:

The main page contains instructions for how to select a character, followed by a button to click to go to the character creation page. Below the button loops images of the different classes. There are navigation buttons at the top of the page to the character creation page as well as a page with your created character.

Clicking on the ‘Create a Character’ button below the instructions or ‘Character Sheet’ button in the title bar of the page takes you to the character creation page. This page contains more detailed instructions on how to create your character, followed by a button that simulates a dice roll. Clicking on the ‘Roll the Dice’ button changes the text of the button to a number. Using the provided material to fill in data for the character, the data will then be sent to the database for later use when the ‘Submit’ button is clicked. This can be viewed in the ‘My Character’ tab.

Opening the ‘My Character’ tab will display all of the information that has been filled previously in regarding your character. This information can be used as future reference for playing Dungeons and Dragons. Clicking the ‘Remove’ button next to each reference to a character will delete that character from the database.
